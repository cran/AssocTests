\description{
Test for the association between a biallelic SNP and a
quantitative trait using the maximum value of the three
nonparametric trend tests derived for the recessive, additive, and
dominant models. It is a robust procedure against the genetic
models.
}
\details{
Under the null hypothesis of no association, the vector of the
three nonparametric tests under the recessive, additive, and
dominant models asymptotically follows a three-dimensional normal
distribution. The p-value can be calculated using the function
\link{pmvnorm} in the R package "\pkg{mvtnorm}".

This test is different from the MAX3 test using in the function
\link{max3}. On one hand, the NMAX3 applies to the quantitative
traits association studies. However, the MAX3 is used in the
case-control association studies. On the other hand, the NMAX3 is
based on the nonparametric trend test. However, the MAX3 is based
on the Cochran-Armitage trend test.
